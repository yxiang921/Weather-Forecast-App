# Weather Forecast App
This project is a comprehensive weather forecast application developed using Flutter, demonstrating my skills in building cross-platform apps. I designed and implemented the app to provide real-time weather updates and forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API. Key features include:

- Real-Time Weather Data: Displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Forecasting: Offers detailed hourly weather forecasts.
- Clean Architecture: Utilizes best practices in Flutter development, including separation of UI, model and service logic.

This app highlights my ability to integrate external APIs, manage state efficiently, and create a polished user interface. It serves as a practical example of my expertise in Flutter development, showcasing my capacity to deliver functional and user-friendly applications.
